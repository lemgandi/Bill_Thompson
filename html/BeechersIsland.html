    <h2>BEECHER'S ISLAND</h2>
    <h3> Location, Location, Location</h3>
    <div>
      <p class="FirstP">The counties along the New York-Pennsylvania border were
        hunting areas for the Iroquois Confederacy, and were lightly settled
        until the <a href="http://sullivanclinton.com/">Sullivan-Clinton</a>
        expedition broke the Iroquois power during the Revolutionary War. Much
        of the land lining both sides of the border was given by the Continental
        Congress to Philadelphia financiers such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bingham%22">William
          Bingham</a> (for whom Binghamton, NY is named) for settlement of loans
        they made to the Congress. By 1810, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque</a>
        Vally was very sparsely settled. Our Campbells and Hazletts were among
        the first permanent settlers. At that time most of North-Eastern PA was
        still Northampton County. PA's present Tioga County was then Tioga
        Township, Lycoming Co.</p>
      <p> The Cowanesque River flows Easterly for 44 miles, just below the state
        line, joining the Tioga River at Lawrenceville, Tioga Co., PA. It's just
        south of Corning and Painted Post, NY. </p>
      <p> The Beecher family first settled on a small island in the Cowanesque
        River before selling to our Campbells and moving on. Another early
        settler, Daniel Strait moved on and his land was purchased by <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Samuel
          Hazlett</a>, <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>'s
        son-in-law). At that time, only a few, small clearings had been made and
        there were no roads. The small community that grew up there was, not
        surprisingly, called Beecher's Island. See a <a href="NelsonMap.html">map</a>.</p>
      <h3>Journey to Nelson, PA</h3>
      <p> After assembling at Sam Hazlett's farm (which may have been in Monroe
        Co., PA or Lancaster Co., PA) most of the family, accompanied by their
        livestock, left on a difficult migration to Beecher's Island. Making
        that trip were Joseph and <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary</a>; his
        brother <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John</a>; children <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">
          Jane</a>, <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a>, <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James
          Campbell</a>, Sam &amp; <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally
          Campbell Hazlett</a> and the three of their children already born; and
        Sam's younger brother, <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John Hazlett</a>.
        For unknown reasons, a "widow Reed" and her daughters accompanied them
        as far as Lawrenceville. </p>
      <p> Jane CAMPBELL Hazlett's daughter-in-law, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I661">Lucy
          DUNHAM</a> Hazlett, heard the stories from those who made the trip and
        wrote an account:</p>
      <blockquote> "In the spring of 1811 they started on their long and tedious
        journey through mud and rain for Beecher's Island as it was then known.
        Somewhere near Blossburg, one horse fell sick and died. Procuring an ox
        team they continued on their journey. During their stay there, snow fell
        one foot deep. On account of the roads being heavy, some of the family
        were obliged to walk. Samuel driving the team, his young wife willing to
        share the burdens with her husband, walked the whole distance to their
        new home carrying her fifteen month old babe in her arms. " </blockquote>
      <p>However, the diary of the senior Joseph Campbell indicates that they
        left Sam's farm in the fall of 1810, which seems more likely because
        elsewhere Lucy states that they arrived on New Years Day. Another
        account has them arriving New Years Eve. But the journey took weeks, so
        they have to have left in the fall of 1810. Fortunately the cabin the
        Campbells bought from the Beechers was sound.</p>
      <p> As for the cabin Sam bought from Daniel Strait: </p>
      <blockquote>"When they arrived at the place they were to make their home,
        they found no shelter but a hut constructed from logs very roughly put
        together. There was a place between the logs so wide a cat could crawl
        through, and no chimney, stones set up against the logs constituted
        their fireplace. They were obliged to take up four bushels of ashes
        before a fire could be made. The bark covering for a roof was all the
        protection they had from storms and wild beasts that stormed around in
        fearful numbers, wolves, catamounts, and bears. They were obliged to
        keep fires going all night to scare them away. The pigs, sheep and stock
        of all kinds had to be kept in high pens near the house, and sometimes
        when the wolves became very fierce the lambs and pigs were taken into
        the house until they would leave to seek food elsewhere. Their meat
        consisted of wild game and fish which was plentiful." </blockquote>
      <h3>After Arrival</h3>
      <p>This was still wilderness. Very little of the land had been cleared.
        Most of the "bottom land" was covered with giant white pines. To clear
        the land, they girdled the trees to kill them. Then burned them down.
        Clearing the stumps took years. Often the stumps were pulled&nbsp; and
        placed in a row, forming fences that kept livestock in a pasture. </p>
      <h3>Beecher's Island Presbyterian Church</h3>
      <p>At first, Beecher's Island only had a handful of families and of course
        did not have a church of it's own, nor were there any nearby. <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James</a>
        and <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> Campbell joined
        an Congregational church when it formed in Elkland in 1834. </p>
      <p> In their 1976 work, <font style="font-style: italic;">Elkland and
          Osceola "As We See It"</font> Ray and Sandy Crawford wrote: </p>
      <blockquote> "families who first settled in this valley were mainly from
        the New England states. The Bulkleys, Bottums, Bacons, Blanchards,
        Coates, Culvers, Clarks, Cooks, Dorrances, Hills, Hammonds, Hoyts,
        Ryons, Seelys and Tubbs’ were from Connecticut; the Gleasons, Knoxes and
        Barkers from Massachusetts; the Wrights and Parkhursts from New
        Hampshire; the Crandalls from Rhode Island. These had passed their early
        days under the iron rule of the New England hierarchy whose form of
        church government was mainly Congregational. At Beecher’s Island there
        were several Scotch-Irish families – the Campbells, Hazletts, Ellisons,
        Meginleys. These had been reared in the strict Calvinistic faith that
        prevailed in the North of Ireland, whose form of church government was
        Presbyterian. In faith there was no essential difference. These families
        came one by one, or in small detachments, and at different times. They
        had severed such church connections as they might have had at places of
        former residence. They brought no pastor with them. From such
        heterogeneous and scattered material, after much delay, was this church
        gathered."</blockquote>
      <p> Later in 1834, two small congregations in Elkland merged to form the
        First Congregational Church, which sometimes met in Osceola or in the
        2nd floor of James Campbell's home. (In which he had operated a tavern
        before he "got religion.")</p>
      <blockquote>"Members of that church were: <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph
          Campbell</a> and <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann</a> his wife,
        Hannah Snow, Abigail Snow, Harriet Boyer, <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John
          Hazlett</a>, <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch Blackwell</a>,
        Patty Johnson, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I211">Content
          Bottum</a>, Betsy O’Brien, Elizabeth Tubbs. December 31, of the same
        year, there was another accession of members in the persons of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1045">Nancy
          Bosard</a>, Maria Bosard, <a href="LuggCharles1791.html">Charles Lugg</a>
        and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I49">Richard
          Ellison</a>." </blockquote>
      <p> In 1835 the congregation changed their affiliation and became the
        Elkland Presbyterian Church. Our Campbells, Hazletts, et al, were active
        and rented reserved pews, as was customary then.</p>

      </p>
      <p> In 1844, the Presbytery authorized formation of a Presbyterian Church
        at Beechers Island. Members were:<br>
      </p>
      <blockquote> "Joel Jewel and Mary his wife, <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph
          Campbell</a> and <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann</a> his wife, <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James
          Campbell</a> and <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary</a> his wife,

          Blanchard</a>, Robert Casbeer and Susan his wife and <a href="BlackwellEnoch1814.html">Enoch
          Blackwell</a>. Total, twenty-two."</blockquote>
      <p> Joseph and James Campbell, and John Hazlett were deacons.</p>
      <p> Building the church was a large projects. John Hazlett provided the
        timber. His brother Sam's saw mill turned the logs into lumber. The
        Campbells and others did the carpentry work. When the walls were ready
        to lift into place, the community turned out for a big "raising". Ann
        CLINCH Campbell and her half-sister, Mary BLACKWELL Campbell, did the
        baking, other women of the congregation would have helped provide food
        for the occasion.</p>
      <h3>The Fate of Beecher's Island</h3>
      <p> For many years the community that grew up near the island was know as
        Beechers Island. The reason for changing the post office name to Nelson
        is unknown. The community grew to have two main East-West streets, one
        on each side of the river, and a North-South street, named Depot St.
        because the railroad station was located there. A portion of Depot
        Street still exists. At it's peak, Nelson had two hotels, two churches
        (Presbyterian and Methodist), a school, a milliners shop, a dry goods
        store, smithy, barber shop, livery stable, furniture stores (some of
        which doubled as undertakers), general stores, feed and farm equipment
        stores, a grist mill, a fulling mill, an Odd Fellow's Hall, a cemetery,
        and on the Hazlett farm, the original Campbell-Hazlett burial ground.</p>
      <p> The advent of automobiles led to the gradual decline of the Boro of
        Nelson. In horse and buggy days, villages like Nelson were needed every
        few miles so that farmers could bring a wagon load of crops to sell and
        bring back supplies. With cars and trucks, people could travel 20 or 30
        miles to sell and buy. Communities such as Corning and Elmira had good
        paying jobs as alternatives to farm work. Nelson's population
        dramatically declined (as did many small towns then),&nbsp; and almost
        all the businesses closed except for the general store.</p>
      <p> Many now living saw an island just upstream from Ne;son. PA route
        follows the south side of the Cowanesque River and went through Nelson's
        south side. When Westbound on PA 49, if you looked to your left as you
        exited Nelson and crossed the river, an island could easily be seen.
        Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I0951">Bruce
          Rupar</a> remembers camping on it as a boy. Perhaps it was a remnant
        of the original Beecher's Island. Perhaps it was a much more recent
        island, formed by 20th century floods.</p>
      <p> All that changed when creation of <a href="http://www.srbc.net/programs/cowan_proj.htm">Cowanesque
          Lake</a> was authorized in 1960 as a flood control project. The
        Methodist church and some homes were relocated (after a campaign
        organized by <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I2586">Ila
          HESS</a> Lugg Wiley), but most of the hamlet was bulldozed and its
        location lies under the lake. After a dry summer when the level of the
        lake is low, if you know where to look, the remains of the island can
        still be seen. But it's now just a mud flat.</p>
      <p> The good news is that there still is a community of Nelson, in Nelson
        Township. It's much, much smaller than in 1900 or even 1950, but the
        former Methodist church survives. Its congregation, and that of the
        Presbyterian church merged. (See <a href="http://www.unitedchurchofnelson.com/index.php">United
          Church of Nelson</a>.) There's also a post office, fire station and
        fire hall. And some Campbell descendants still live there. Some new
        businesses have sprung up to serve the need of those fishing, swimming,
        picnicking, or camping at the lake. Sadly, the Beecher's Island
        Presbyterian Church building, which survived the lake project, was not
        needed, was allowed to fall into disrepair, and was demolished as
        unsafe. <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane CAMPBELL</a> Tubbs and <a
          href="SeelyMarcus1847.html">Mark Seely</a> would have been heartbroken
        if they knew their beloved church was torn down.</p>
