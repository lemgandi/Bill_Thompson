      <p>1. This was at the beginning the Korean War. He was in the army, part
        of an anti-aircraft artillery unit, protecting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site">Hanford
          Works</a>, in WA, where the US produced plutonium. During WW2 he tried
        to enlist in every branch of the military and the Coast Guard. All
        turned him down because he was color blind, post-polio, and had had
        multiple surgeries for hernias. Strangely, just as his draft eligibility
        was about to expire, he was drafted -- along with a bunch of others who
        had been 4-F during the war too. All flunked out of basic training
        except him.</p>

      <p>2. They were expecting their first child.</p>
      <p>3. At the time of the letter, he was a corporal, but at the end of
        October was promoted to Sgt. In 1950, military pay was terrible,
        especially family allowances. Privates pay was $96 to $103/mo. depending
        on length of service. For Corporals it was $118 to 125. For Sgts. $140
        to 147.</p>
      <p>For family allowances things were even worse. They stopped drafting
        married men because the allowances, unchanged since 1943, were too low
        to support a family&nbsp; The bill Hank mentioned&nbsp; passed and went
        into effect at the at the end of Oct. For privates it raised the monthly
        family support allotments as follows: Privates with one dependent it was
        raised to $45/mo. For Privates with two dependents or Corporals &amp;
        Sgts. with one&nbsp; or two dependents it was raised to $67.50. </p>
      <p> Ellen later described that time to her children: "Before the dependent
        allowance came in, they were just scraping by. When Hank went out into
        the field, Ellen sent him with a loaf of bread made into PB&amp;J
        sandwiches. (Her father sent her the jam, which they could not have
        afforded.) She subsisted mostly on beans and cornbread (baked in a
        wood-fueled oven). She always hated beans afterwards. A neighbor who was
        a nurse fed her some salad, which was a rare treat. She was malnourished
        and had a difficult delivery and post-partum recovery."</p>
      <p>What a shameful way to treat a draftee and his family!</p>

        <p>7. My parents nicknamed my eldest brother "Tom" soon after my mother
          first felt him moving. That baby turned out to be a boy and the name
          stuck -- even tho his birth certificate says "Walter Frederick
          Thompson, Jr. So "Mike" may have been Hank &amp; Ellen's nickname for
          the baby they were expecting. If so, their guess about its sex was
          wrong. But they did get to recycle it later.</p>
